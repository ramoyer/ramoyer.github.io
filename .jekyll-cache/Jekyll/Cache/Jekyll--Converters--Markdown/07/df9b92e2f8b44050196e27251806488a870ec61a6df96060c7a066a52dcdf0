<p>With the current pandemic, shortages of PPE, and growing mandates to wear masks in public, many people are turning to making their own.  However, when my family and I started making masks in early April, it was hard to find even any qualitative data on the performance of the t-shirts, quilting fabric, or coffee filters that were being used. So, I created a simple aerosol machine I could attach to candidate materials.</p>

<p>To create a sneeze-like aerosol, I decided to use the venturi effect to draw water into an air stream and aerosolize it, similar to a carburetor in a small engine. I used an air compressor with some restrictions to get a moderate flow of air, and attached a 16 guage hypodermic needle across the exit with the taper facing down-stream. The needle was attached with a short piece of tubing to a balloon that served as a water reservoir.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>I tested a 3M N-95 mask, a surgical mask from a convenience store in Egypt, 100% cotton and cotton blend t-shirts, quilting cotton, coffee filters, paper towels, a merino wool head wrap, and a re-usable non-woven grocery bag.</p>

<ol>
  <li>All the ask materials significantly reduced the amount of droplets exiting the bottle</li>
  <li>The 3M mask allowed 0 visible particles through ‚Äì very far above any other material tested</li>
  <li>Several layers increased the filtering function for all materials</li>
</ol>
