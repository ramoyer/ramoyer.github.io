<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>In collaboration with the US Navy, the MIT Lincoln labs had been researching reacting pelletized aluminum fuel with water as an alternative power source for long duration underwater missions.  Aluminium doped with gallium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas at higher energy densities than lithium ion batteries or gasoline can provide.  However, this hydrogen gas contained steam and other impurities that made it poorly suited for electric fuel cell use, so we were tasked with exploring internal combustion as a more robust way to convert this hydrogen into electrical power. So</p>

<p>As previous teams had done a lot of work with the aluminium - water reaction, we got our hydrogen from a tank and only focused on the conversion of hydrogen to electricity.</p>

<h3 id="team">Team</h3>

<p>After the initial group selection, my team started exploring the previous research on our project and planning our approach. Our team was made up of four students: Sam took over the engine, Mitch the hardware connections, Dillon the software, and I handled the air and fuel systems. We were given several small two and four stroke engines from the previous semester, along with a 3 phase skateboard motor with braking capabilities that we could use to generate electricity. We shifted responsiblities and assisted each other quite frequently throughout the semester to get this project done.</p>

<h3 id="air-and-fuel-subsystems">Air and Fuel Subsystems</h3>

<p>We realized very early on that we could harness the wide explosive limits of hydrogen to our advantage.  Gasoline only burns when mixed with a fairly precise mixture of air, roughly 4.0 to 75 percent. Outside of this range, an air-fuel mixture will not ignite at all and the engine will completely lose power, so gasoline engines must reduce air and fuel flow in order to maintain a flammable mixture and control engine speed. However, hydrogen burns over an incredibly large range of concentrations, 4 percent to 70 percent, so engine speed can be controlled just by controlling the flow of fuel. We did some initial testing with a flow meter, and then switched to a fuel injector designed for methane.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>To simplify the software, the speed was controlled by using the inverse of rotational speed, or the time between rotations.  As the system is well-damped over most load ranges, simple proportional control worked well for this setup.  Using the inverse of speed for the calculations means that the controller is not operating with a linear system, but the simple principle of increasing or decreasing fuel to reach a setpoint still works quite well.</p>

<h3 id="fuel-injector-circuit">Fuel Injector Circuit</h3>

<p>Our Bosch fuel injector is designed for a peak-and-hold waveform to rapidly open the solenoid then use a lower power to hold it open.  We could not find any compact drivers for this, so I made one myself.  After doing some research on driver chips and laying that out, I realized I could achieve the same output with fewer parts if I was willing to burn some extra power with a large resistor (R1).</p>

<p>The capacitor charges while the injector is off, and then provides a 48 volt peak that is regulated to a steady level by R1 for the hold portion of the waveform. Note the Zener diode D1 to prevent voltage spikes that could destroy our MOSFET or other circuit components when the drive signal is turned off.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>Like the team before us, we faces some significant challenges.  We had numerous driveshaft failures, fuel system failures (due to a sticky solenoid), code failures that would stall our engine or make it run away, and even logistics issues when the lab ran out of hydrogen.</p>

<h3 id="final-results">Final Results</h3>

<p>We were aiming for a power output of 1 kW, but our power ended up peaking at 35% of full fuel flow, and 35% of expected power output with a thermal efficiency of around 15%. We strongly suspected the low power output was due to poor air-fuel mixing, and both the power and efficiency should increase if this is resolved.  However, by the end of this project, we had started from nearly the ground up and built our own engine control unit, control algorithms, frame, safety systems, and hardware connections and were able to generate electricity from hydrogen.</p>
