I"í<p>Flame wars are a bit of a tradition among MIT undergrads; when somebody forgets to BCC all the dorms or otherwise violates the norms of campus wide emails, inboxes get inundated with random comments, pleas to stop spamming all of campus, and entire movie scripts or book texts from Project Gutenberg.</p>

<p>My only claim to fame is when one of my memes ended up on a set of lecture slides on MIT culture.</p>

<p>But one day I realized that instead of copy-pasting these texts, I could set up a microcontroller to emulate a keyboard and output an entire script on command. Press a button, send a script. No more googling. I could even store the whole movie script on the flash memory of a Teensy 3.2, and I wouldnâ€™t even have to work with an SD card or other media.</p>

<p>So I set up a simple arduino sketch and mounted a few buttons to a breadboard. The script uses the Arduino Keyboard library, identifies itself to the computer as a USB keyboard, and outputs one of three phrases as a depending on the button pressed.</p>

<p>Finally, I set up a python script to properly edit the text copied from the internet into something an Arduino can read, and copied the result into my arduino sketch:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># If line available
for line in readfile:
if(len(line.strip())&gt;2):
	writefile.write(line.strip())
	writefile.write("\\n")
readfile.close()
writefile.close()
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, computer keyboard infrastructure is only designed to handle character input at human-like speeds which slows things down.  There is some margin for higher speeds, but my macbook can only handle 50-100 characters per second.  As a result, it takes around 10 minutes to output an entire movie script. Of course, short phrases are much faster.</p>

<p>But it works!!</p>
