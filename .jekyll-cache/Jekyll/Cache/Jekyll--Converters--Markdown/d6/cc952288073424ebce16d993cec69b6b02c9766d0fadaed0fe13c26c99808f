<h3 id="work-hardening">Work Hardening</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_hardening">Work hardening</a>, also known as cold forging, is a process where metals are deformed without heating to increase their hardness. On an atomic level, this process increases the number of dislocations within a metalâ€™s crystal structure, and on a larger scale, work hardening increases the hardness and also the brittleness of the material.</p>

<p>Because of this increase in brittleness, excessive work hardening has to be avoided for any part that needs to bend before it breaks - like the body of a knife blade.  However, the edge is supported by the rest of the blade, so a hard brittle edge supported by a softer, more pliable body wears down much slower and creates the ultimate blade.  Thatâ€™s what this project set out to create and then measure.</p>

<p>In order to work harden my blades, I took several knife blades, dulled them on a cutting board or a sheet of metal, and then re-formed them into a triangular edge like this:</p>

<h3 id="measuring">Measuring</h3>

<p>In order to measure the blade life, I imitated ISO standard 8442 for measuring knife sharpness and repeatedly cut a stack of 200 sheets of paper with a fixed weight until the knife stopped moving.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>I only completed three trials each with a control and a hardened blade, and I had considerable variation in the hardened blade life - but hardening the blades showed a significant increase in blade life.  For the thre trials I did, the hardened blades had an average of 2.3 times the life of an unhardened blades.</p>

<p>Note the increased error bars for the hardened blades.  Due to the fact that I was hardening these blade by hand, consistency is hard to achieve.  However, the data does indicate that</p>
<ol>
  <li>The unhardened blades have a relatively tight control group</li>
  <li>The hardened blades have a higher variation in life but it is significantly higher than an unhardened blade</li>
</ol>
