	<h1>Hi, I'm Richard Moyer</h1>
	<p>I work as a mechanical engineer, with occasional projects in electrical, chemical, or software engineering.  I grew up on a small farm before attending MIT for my bachelors.  I have experience in many different fields, from agricultural bio-chemical processes and drug dosing to designing combustion chambers, from herding cattle to debugging radio modulation, and from oilfield operations to the intricacies of cross-agency coordination in a 911 system. Iâ€™ve always been able to find common ground with new people and leverage this cross-disciplinary experience to bring new life to projects<p>
