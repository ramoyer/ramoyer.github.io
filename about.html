<h3>Farming</h3>
<p>I grew up in the south-western corner of Virginia, first in the suburbs and then on a small farm.  I like to say I spent my teenage years chasing cows up and down mountains - and it's about half true.  Besides the beef and dairy cows, my family raised vegetables for a farmer's market and oddball items like maple syrup, mushrooms, sorghum molasses, and tomato seed. My family still runs this farm, and every time I go back I drink fresh milk and stock up on comfort food that I can't find in a grocery store.</p>

<p>When I turned 19, I decided I had enough of farming and started down the path to becoming an engineer.  I spent 2 years finishing up my high-school at a community college before attending MIT for my undergrad in mechanical engineering. My years in undergrad were probably the most formative of my life. The classes and the research were amazing, but outside of that, two organizations really shaped who I am: <a href="https://ems.mit.edu">MIT EMS</a> and my dorm, <a href="http://eastcamp.us">East Campus</a></p>

<h3>MIT EMS</h3>
<p>On the ambulance I learned the basics of life-saving treatment, but I also learned how to talk with anybody, deal with the unexpected, and how to run an organization. I also made some of the best friends I'll probably ever have and I will never have a shortage of stories to tell.</p>

<h3>East Campus</h3>
<p>And at East Campus, I found a group of people that was just as excited as I was to be themselves, climb everything, build wild structures every year, and do things people said couldn't be done.</p>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>I really enjoy cooking. Most of the time it is practical, pasta, sauteed vegetables, meat, and rice, avocado toast with a fried egg, or smoothies, but sometimes I go fancy and find somebody with camera skills to document it.</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Sometimes I travel.  In addition to a bunch of US states, I've lived in Korea, the UAE, Egypt, and Honduras for more than 3 weeks, and visited both Iceland and Greece for a few days.</p>
