	<h1>Hi, I'm Richard Moyer</h1>
	<p>I am a mechanical engineer with past experience in product design, precision machine design, and high-volume manufacturing. I am currently enrolled in MIT’s LGO program – a dual degree business and engineering program focused on developing the next generation of engineering leadership in manufacturing and operations.<p>
	<p>I grew up on a farm in rural south-western Virginia, went to MIT for my undergrad, and have since worked overseas in oil and gas, designed surgical and medical devices at 2 Boston-based firms, and designed and built manufacturing equipment at sites in Massachusetts and Minnesota.</p>
	<p>Besides engineering, I have worked as an EMT, arborist, and butcher, I’ve worked for the United Nations, a water/sewer utility, and Cirque du Soleil. I grew up making maple syrup with my family, tanning my own leather, and preserving fruit, nuts, meats, and mushrooms from the family farm. I still garden when I can, gather wild foods from the forest, and practice the culinary arts as a way to explore the world around me.</p>
