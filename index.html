	<h1>Hi, I'm Richard Moyer</h1>
	<p>I work as an engineer – or maybe you can call me a problem solver.  I grew up on a small farm before attending MIT for a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I have experience in many different fields, from bio-chemical processes and drug dosing to designing combustion chambers, from herding cattle to debugging radio modulation schemes, and from dynamic control systems to the intricacies of cross-agency coordination in a 911 system. I’ve always been able to find common ground with new people and leverage this cross-disciplinary experience to bring new life to projects<p>
